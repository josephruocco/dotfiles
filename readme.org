* Installing
There are two install (you'll have to manually install the programs,
 this only hosts my configs) methods, made for users' ease.
** Install everything with symlinks
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/josephruocco/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install
#+END_SRC
** Install specific programs with symlinks
(let PROGRAM be the placeholder you replace, eg to install emacs you
would replace PROGRAM with emacs in the following block)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/josephruocco/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install PROGRAM
#+END_SRC
** Install specific programs without symlinks
(let PROGRAM be the placeholder you replace, eg to install emacs you
would replace PROGRAM with emacs in the following block)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/josephruocco/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
cp -r PROGRAM ~/
#+END_SRC
